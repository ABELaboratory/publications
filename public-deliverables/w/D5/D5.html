<p>The European Accessibility Act (EAA)<a
        href="#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> is
a European Union (EU) Directive that <i>aims to improve the functioning
of the internal market for accessible products and services by removing
barriers created by divergent rules in Member States</i><a

        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
The EAA will take effect in June 2025, requiring many products and
services, including ebooks categorised as services, to comply with
accessibility requirements.</p>
<p>One particularly important topic is how a publisher can evaluate the
impact of converting the inaccessible ebooks of its backlist into
versions compliant with the accessibility requirements of the EAA.
Earlier studies have shown very different results. In particular, the
issues related to different categories of ebooks have not been
addressed. At the same time, some companies are offering tools for
converting existing EPUB 2 and PDF files into accessible EPUB 3
versions, but it is not always so clear which issues these tools
practically solve.</p>
<p>Given the limited timeframe and the fact that many parties have
limited resources to investigate this topic, we have set up the
Accessible Backlist Ebooks Laboratory (ABE Lab), a project funded by the
EU Creative Europe program. The goal of this project is to centralise
some of the necessary research and share the results with anyone
interested.</p>
<p>To get insight into the possibilities and costs of remediation, the
partners of the ABE Lab project, European Digital Reading Lab (EDRLab),
Fondazione LIA and KB – National Library of the Netherlands, conducted
research activities to provide information on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The size and composition of the ebook backlists at European and
national levels,</p></li>
<li><p>Recurrent elements that cause accessibility issues,</p></li>
<li><p>how to categorise clusters of ebooks which may have similar
remediation issues,</p></li>
<li><p>tools available on the market that can help with the remediation
of ebooks of different formats (EPUB, PDF) and different categories
(fiction, non-fiction, STEM, children's book…),</p></li>
<li><p>costs estimates of remediation<a

<p>According to a World Blind Union (WBU) estimation, persons with
reading disabilities - for instance, blind, visually impaired or
dyslexic people - have access to less than 10 per cent of the yearly
book production<a
        href="#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, depending on the country they live
in. The term “book famine” was coined some years ago to describe this.
The books they have access to are, in most cases, specific adaptations
of printed books created in small quantities by specialised libraries,
associations for the blind, or similar organisations, or digital books
whose level of accessibility can vary greatly.</p>
<p>The European Accessibility Act (Directive (EU) 2019/882, acronym EAA)
will come into force in June 2025. The Directive mandates that various
services, including ebooks, adhere to accessibility requirements, in
line with the principles of <i>design for all</i> and <i>born
accessible</i>. This means taking into account all the needs and
possibilities from the conception of the services to be able to create
quality services that can be used also by people with disabilities. It
is part of the European strategy for the rights of persons with
disabilities 2021-2030<a
        href="#fn5"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, which addresses several major
themes: accessibility, equality, education, social protection,
employment and more. With this, Europe is committed to an inclusive
policy that makes people with disabilities a core objective.</p>
<p>The publishing industry worldwide agrees that EPUB is the only
digital book format that allows, with a few efforts, the creation of
fully accessible ebooks. Most titles have already been published in
EPUB, and the first accessible titles are now on sale.</p>
<p>However, there is still an issue with the majority of ebooks
published before 2025: a backlist of 3.5 million titles in Europe. Since
one of the objectives of the Directive is to end the book famine endured
by visually impaired people, it is important to transform as many titles
as possible into accessible EPUB files. To do so, publishers need to
have a clear view of the gaps to be filled to make their ebooks
compliant and of the related costs per type of ebook.</p>
<h2
      id="markwhat-is-accessibilitymark"><mark>What is
accessibility?</mark></h2>
<p>Accessibility means that tools, technologies, websites, ebooks and
digital documents are designed and developed so that everyone,
regardless of their disabilities - physical, cognitive, motor,
situational or age-related - can use them. Accessibility is fundamental
to providing equal access to information, study, entertainment and equal
opportunities to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>In addition to being required by the regulatory frameworks in many
countries worldwide, accessibility is a social value and a basic human
right recognised by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD)<a

<p>Accessibility is also part of a global quality process. It is good
for business, improving the experience and satisfaction for all users.
This means that attention has been paid to providing correct hierarchy
and semantic tagging of the information, that rich and understandable
navigation options are available, and that information about the
available features is properly provided. By enforcing standards rules,
accessibility also <span
        role="doc-pagebreak"

<h2
      id="what-are-remediation-tools">What are remediation tools?</h2>
<p>In recent years, accessibility in the digital world has become
increasingly relevant, especially in light of the new European and
national regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>This has led to improvements in ebook production tools, which have
progressively integrated specific functionalities to support the
production of accessible EPUB and PDF files, allowing publishers to
publish and market ebooks that are already accessible, following the
<i>born accessible</i> paradigm. Not only the tools but the formats
themselves have evolved in terms of the accessibility features
supported, and accessible guidelines for the EPUB and PDF formats have
been published, providing publishers with clear reference specifications
to produce accessible ebooks compliant with international and EAA
accessibility requirements. As a consequence, production workflows have
also started to take accessibility into account.</p>
<p>A new type of tool and service is increasingly emerging to fix the
accessibility of ebooks and digital documents produced in past years.
These tools, which may take the form of online cloud platforms, desktop
applications, or SDKs, are designed to receive an ebook or digital
document that does not comply with international accessibility
requirements as input and return an ebook that should be accessible and
compliant as output.</p>
<p>They come with different features and access methods: some can be
freely downloaded and used, while others require a paid account
activation and configuration, which in turn may require direct contact
with the developers and marketing or sales managers. The types of
licences may also differ by tool provider: they may provide unlimited
access to the tool or include a maximum number of files uploaded and
remediated; they can provide a monthly, semestrial, annual or other
subscription formula, often different for private users and companies.
Some are fully automatic, while others allow the manual modification of
the document content.</p>
<p>Finally, tools based on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
are also beginning to appear and spread; these tools can potentially be
trained to respond to the specific needs of a publisher's workflow or
the characteristics of a specific ebook series.</p>
<p>As can be seen, the world of these tools is very composite and
varied. In this document, we’ll refer to these types of technological
solutions as <i>remediation tools</i>.</p>

<p>ABE Lab has two main objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to collect and analyse in detail the composition of the European
ebook backlist;</p></li>
<li><p>to provide guidelines to European publishers to boost the
remediation of the ebooks from their backlist.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main expected impacts in the short term (before 2025) are the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Publishers, Publisher Associations, blind unions, and public
services have, for the first time, a clear picture of the status of the
European ebook backlist;</p></li>
<li><p>Publishers can use the classification to evaluate the composition
of their own ebook backlist;</p></li>
<li><p>Some larger publishers and service providers will build
remediation workflows;</p></li>
<li><p>Ebooks that are easy to remediate will be processed through these
technical workflows;</p></li>
<li><p>Publishers can calculate the cost of remediation for each segment
of their backlist and decide on priorities for remediation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the medium term (2025, 2026), the expected impacts are that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More publishers and service providers will build remediation
workflows;</p></li>
<li><p>The analysis of the first bulk of remediation will enhance the
efficiency of the technical workflows. More automated processes and
Artificial Intelligence techniques will be integrated into the
remediation tools;</p></li>
<li><p>Ebooks that necessitate limited manual processing will be
processed through enhanced technical workflows;</p></li>
<li><p>Publishers can use this analysis to evaluate the cost of
generation of natively accessible EPUB 3 ebooks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the long term (2026, 2030), the expected impacts are that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every European publisher has chosen which backlist ebooks will be
made accessible, which titles will be considered disproportionately
burdensome, and which titles will be removed from the market;</p></li>
<li><p>Ebooks deemed to be made accessible will be processed through
enhanced technical workflows;</p></li>
<li><p>EPUB 3 eventually replaced older ebook formats (PDF, EPUB
2).</p></li>

<p>The ABE Lab project aims to provide publishers with reliable
information about options and costs for remediation to make backlist
ebooks accessible. This project objective was achieved by collecting and
analysing data about the European ebook backlist and analysing and
testing the processes and workflows by which ebooks of different types
and formats (PDF, EPUB reflowable and EPUB Fixed Layout) can be
transformed into accessible EPUB in the easiest and less expensive way.
This implies knowing which remediation tools are available on the market
and what they can do, for which formats and types of books (fiction,
complex layouts, STEM) they are most effective, and their
shortcomings.</p>
<p>The first part of the project was therefore focused on collecting and
analysing data to define the size and composition of the European ebook
backlist—defined as the collection of all ebooks available on the EU
market—and on identifying the most recurrent accessibility issues in
these ebooks. The public deliverable Report on Backlist Data and Gap
Analysis details the results.</p>
<p>In the second part, the partners tested several workflows using
existing open-source and commercial tools to remediate inaccessible
ebooks of different types and formats (PDF, EPUB 2, EPUB 3 reflowable,
and Fixed Layout). The study considered ebooks with different levels of
complexity to evaluate the relative effort associated with correcting
the accessibility issues.</p>
<p>It is essential to have tools that can correct the accessibility
errors identified in the backlist files or offer the human operators
options and features that support them in their remediation activity.
Consequently, testing existing remediation tools has been fundamental to
ABE Lab. The results of these tests form the basis of the whitepaper
<i>Guidelines for remediation tool producers</i> and the starting
point of the guidance we can provide to publishers as an outcome of the
project<i>.</i></p>
<h2
      id="project-management-wp1">Project management (WP1)</h2>
<p>The project was coordinated by EDRLab, operated by a core team, and
strategically driven by a Steering Committee. The project partners
allocated additional resources for each work package. All working
documents were stored on a shared drive, and communication was mainly by
email. A chat solution was also available for daily discussions.</p>
<p>The project core team met online regularly and performed all
activities. The Steering Committee met two times in person and three
times online. Two status reports were produced at 6 and 12 months. All
decisions were made on consensus.</p>

<p>This activity was composed of two tasks: collecting data on the
European ebook backlist and analysing them, and collecting backlist
ebooks from publishers from different EU countries. Details are given in

<h3
      id="markbacklist-datamark"><mark>Backlist Data</mark></h3>
<p>Without specific information about the composition of ebook backlists
in Europe, it's challenging to determine the best workflows, remediation
costs, and potential growth of accessible ebooks before and after the
European Accessibility Act (EAA). This lack of data also makes it hard
to measure the EAA's success in the ebook industry. To plan the next
steps of the project, data was collected and analysed. This formed the
basis for subsequent reports publicly published.</p>
<p>As there's no single European source providing data about the number
and types of ebooks available, many organisations were contacted. These
include publication registration offices, distributors, aggregators,
resellers, and national libraries. However, since each organisation only
has a portion of the data, and there are overlaps, conclusions must be
drawn carefully. A blind spot is that a significant part of the EU
market's ebook backlist comes from e-commerce platforms and
international distributors and retailers, especially those from the UK,
the USA, and Canada.</p>
<p>The report examines the size and composition of EU ebooks backlists
and their segmentation and provides useful trends and insights for the
research on the topic. It outlines the approach taken, including
challenges faced, and gives an overview of the segmentation by subject,
format, and year of production. The main findings are summarised in the
<i>Insights</i> section, and the <i>Outcomes</i> section explains
how this work was used to shape subsequent project activities.</p>
<h3
      id="markgap-analysismark"><mark>Gap Analysis</mark></h3>
<p>The objective of this activity was to provide an overview of the gaps
between the accessibility level of the ebook titles available on the EU
market and the EAA target accessibility requirements. The report exposes
an analysis methodology to help identify recurrent accessibility issues
per category of ebooks that will need remediation to meet the EAA
requirements.</p>
<p>This analysis was possible thanks to the collaboration with
publishing houses that agreed to provide us with samples of their
existing ebooks, matching a wishlist established to reflect the
articulation of the backlists as well as possible. These publishers
received a document describing in detail the methodology developed and
applied to identify the most recurrent accessibility issues and classify
the ebooks according to the potential complexity of the remediation
activity needed to make them accessible. This document was released on
the 30th of October 2023 and was shared with contributing publishers
only.</p>

<p>It is crucial to know which technological solutions for remediating
inaccessible ebooks are available on the market and in the open-source
community, what they can do, and with which level of accuracy. This
information is key to providing publishers with reliable indications on
which tools they can use to remediate their backlist ebooks. The choice
may depend on ebook categories (fiction, biography, law, STEM, ...),
input formats, desired output formats and specific accessibility issues
of the input files.</p>
<p>Therefore, the objectives of this activity were to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>identify the available tools;</p></li>
<li><p>establish a testing methodology for assigning a score to the
tools based on the results produced;</p></li>
<li><p>provide an overview of the tools tested, divided by remediation
flows. For each tested tool it includes general information about the
product, its evaluation and the score it has obtained.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Discovering and testing the remediation tools available on the market
or developed by the open-source community was the focus of the second
phase of the project. This phase consisted of the following macro
activities:</p>
<ol
      type="1">
<li><p>active search for remediation tools. The tools were found through
desk research and by exploiting the professional network of the project
partners;</p></li>
<li><p>mapping the functionalities of these tools using a matrix of
functionalities;</p></li>
<li><p>expert people testing the tools and analysing the remediated
files to assess their performance, i.e. which accessibility issues they
can solve automatically or semi-automatically, and assessing the extent
of manual intervention that each tool requires to output a fully
accessible ebook.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Our research allowed us to identify 24 remediation tools, of which 13
were selected for the testing phase. Aside from the internal report on
this activity, a public white paper was published to provide high-level
guidelines that producers and developers of remediation tools can use to
design or improve their tools. This white paper highlights the
requirements that remediation tools should meet to be effective and to
support human operators by making the process as simple, intuitive and
fluid as possible, depending also on the competence of the target users.
These activities are detailed in internal documents that have been used
to build the public deliverables.</p>
<p>This is the first time, as far as we know, that a study has conducted
systematic tests on this category of tools to assess their potential and
limitations.</p>

      id="mark11analysis-of-remediation-costs-wp4mark"><mark>Analysis
of remediation costs (WP4)</mark></h2>
<p>Previous activities have helped the project partners better
understand the composition of the EU ebook backlist, establish a gap
analysis methodology and test remediation tools. The main activity of
this WP was to estimate the time and cost of all the activities that
publishers and actors involved in ebook production must undertake to
remediate backlist titles.</p>
<p>To achieve that, we proceeded in two ways: on one side, we
interviewed publishers who have already started remediating their
backlist, and on the other, we conducted tests to obtain representative
times for the correction of specific accessibility problems and the
entire remediation process for selected samples of varying size and
complexity.</p>
<p>Interviewing publishers allowed us to determine that understanding
the evolution of production processes is crucial. It also emphasised the
need for prior analysis and for gathering information about effective
practices. Publishers who outsource all of their ebook production
mentioned that they struggle to evaluate the technical condition of
their backlist titles.. The preferred method for these publishers is to
first examine the economic feasibility of making their backlist titles
accessible. They estimate which titles would be worth investing a
similar amount to creating a new accessible ebook, and then request
price quotes from their service providers.</p>
<p>For testing activity, we first selected, based on our analysis, files
with an average number of accessibility issues from different categories
and formats (PDF, EPUB and EPUB Fixed Layout) out of the samples that
collaborating publishers provided in WP2. The choice was a balanced
mixture between what is most represented, and the actual files we had at
disposal. We selected thema identifiers F, Y, J, M, L, (respectively,
for Fiction, Children’s books, Society and social sciences, Medicine and
Nursing, Law) and refined them with an analysis of the features
available in each file.</p>
<p>Based on WP3's findings, a set of tools was selected for remediating
each sample based on the starting format and the complexity of the
content (images, links, tables, notes, …). The remediation was carried
out by an experienced operator who has previously handled conversion and
remediation activities, with an in-depth knowledge of publishers'
production workflows, a proven track record in page layout programs
(InDesign), and a solid understanding of ebooks accessibility
requirements. The remediation process was structured into several
steps:</p>
<ol
      type="1">
<li><p>automatic remediation, to assess what the tools can fix
automatically;</p></li>
<li><p>tool-driven remediation (through accessibility error reports
provided by the tool, in-tool guidance, etc.);</p></li>
<li><p>manual remediation within the tool, using the options and
functionalities provided by the tools itself;</p></li>
<li><p>manual remediation using different tools, to correct those
accessibility errors that the tool does not allow to be corrected
effectively and, therefore, are still found in the output of step 3.
Fixing these errors usually requires direct intervention in the HTML
code (we, therefore, used an editor software named Sigil, which allows
us to manipulate the EPUB code);</p></li>
<li><p>semantic enrichment. This was an additional step aimed at getting
semantically richer EPUBs beyond the compliance strictly needed to be in
line with the accessibility requirements defined by the EAA.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We also conducted two preliminary actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>file analysis to assess possible problems and</p></li>
<li><p>file format conversion, when necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span
        role="doc-pagebreak"
        id="page12"
        aria-label="Page 12"></span>We monitored the time required for the execution of each
step using a matrix prepared for this purpose. For each step, we
reported the time required to correct the different accessibility
problems, starting with the most recurring ones from the gap analysis of
WP2. This allowed us, for each combination of file and tool, to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>know the total time needed for each step;</p></li>
<li><p>identify which accessibility issues can actually be fixed in each
step (thus, for each tool, which can be corrected in step 1
automatically, and which require manual intervention with the same or a
different tool);</p></li>
<li><p>know the time required to solve each accessibility issue in the
step in which it was solved (except for step 1, for which only the total
time can be measured).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of step 1 (automatic remediation), the total time
required for the tool to complete the process was reported aside as time
spent by the machine is not priced the same as human time.</p>
<p>This approach allowed us to have an overall, detailed overview of the
time associated with the remediation activity for each file and tool.
The related internal deliverable <i>Cost benchmark report</i> (SEN)
was finalised on the 15th of April, 2024.</p>
<h2
      id="markcommunication-and-dissemination-wp5mark"><mark>Communication
and Dissemination (WP5)</mark></h2>
<p>The project communication and dissemination activities are conducted
in 3 main temporalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an initial communication period to inform about the
project;</p></li>
<li><p>a continuous information delivery;</p></li>
<li><p>a final communication stage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The initial communication's objective was to enlist publishers
interested in the project. This was done at the first level with
national workshops and individual talks in France, Italy and the
Netherlands in local languages and organised independently by each
project partner. At a second level, we presented the project in English
to publishers' associations with the help of the Federation of European
Publishers. We also presented the project to Inclusive Publishing
members and at the Include! Conference organised by MTM, the Swedish
agency for accessible books in Malmö, Sweden. Complementary to those
presentations, the three project partners produced news on their website
and communication on their social media. A blog article was published by
IPA. This phase allowed for widespread knowledge about the project and
provided us with more publishers willing to collaborate with the project
than expected.</p>
<p>Continuous information was spread throughout the project, with key
points for releasing public deliverables, for which webinars were
organised to give direct feedback to the publishers involved in the
project. The project was also presented at book fairs in Bruxelles and
Bologna.</p>
<p>The final communication stage starts with the publication of this
final report and will be composed of workshops at national and
international levels. Press releases, event presence and material used
in public presentations are available on the project website<a

<h2
      id="high-variability-of-available-data">High variability of

<p>Collecting data on the backlist ebook titles available over Europe
resulted in a challenging activity since no centralised agency exists
and the way industry standards are adopted and used is not yet
consistent across all European countries (including identification,
categorizations, and other bibliographic metadata).</p>
<p>There’s a notable blind spot regarding the ebooks available through
large online international platforms like Amazon and Kobo. We do not
know how much of those contents are exclusive (like self-published
titles), and therefore, remediation needs cannot be studied for these
ebooks.</p>
<p>Regarding the ebooks available for any reseller or library, no
centralised or harmonised system exists to collect data, resulting in
the need to collect data from different sources (ISBN agencies, national
libraries, distributors<a
        href="#fn13"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref13"

and data service providers). Therefore, counting the ebooks available on
the EU market revealed some caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>some titles are published in more than one digital format (like
EPUB, PDF, KF8), which results in counting manifestations<a
            href="#fn15"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref15"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>,
not unique works;</p></li>
<li><p>some ebook titles get a new ISBN with a new version, so again, we
do not count unique works, but different manifestations of the same
ebook;</p></li>
<li><p>some ISBN agencies do not assign directly ISBNs on a per-title
basis. Instead, they give publishers a large range of numbers to use and
the publishers themselves assign the ISBNs to their titles. As a result,
these ISBN agencies do not have a record of how many titles are
published;</p></li>
<li><p>not all ISBN agencies are informed when ebooks are withdrawn from
the market;</p></li>
<li><p>some distributors and aggregators handle only a part of the
market. For instance, only trade books or scientific books, or only
books in certain languages, meaning that relying on data provided by a
single distributor or aggregator is insufficient to obtain a complete
overview, and we must therefore extend the collection to multiple
parties. In addition, when we receive aggregated data and not detailed
information to the individual ISBN level, it is impossible to know if
different collections overlap and how relevant this overlap is, so we
need to be careful with putting these together;</p></li>
<li><p>some EU distributors and aggregators supply titles from non-EU
publishers in addition to titles published in their country. Without
detailed data and information, it is impossible to distinguish between
titles that are published in the country itself and titles produced by
foreign publishers, which also might have an overlap with the titles we
count in other EU countries;</p></li>
<li><p>retailers sometimes collect titles from multiple distributors and
aggregators, so it is also not possible to rely purely on the numbers
resellers provide; platforms that operate worldwide hardly provide
detailed information about their collections. And since they operate

For example, Amazon does not only provide ebooks with an ISBN, which is
produced by publishers but also a lot of self-published titles, often
without an ISBN.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2
      id="the-european-backlist-is-not-homogeneous">The European backlist
is not homogeneous </h2>
<p>Beyond difficulties in collecting and harmonising available
information, the analysis of backlist data showed that big differences
exist between the collections of different EU countries, and no common
denominator is emerging. Even repartition based on the size of the
national backlist is not sufficient to categorise the European
market.</p>
<p>To group titles for our project, we chose to refer to the Thema
subject category scheme<a
        href="#fn16"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref16"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> developed and maintained by
EDItEUR. Thema aims to be the subject categorization scheme for a global
book trade and is currently the most commonly used classification
methodology. Even if the use of Thema classification has progressed a
lot in the last few years, it must be noted that is not the only
classification used, and since it is still relatively new, not all
ebooks have been assigned Thema codes yet.</p>
<p>To resolve this inconsistency, EDItEUR provides a series of documents
mapping codes from different book schemas to Thema codes.<a
        href="#fn17"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref17"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
Because different standard classifications have different logics, those
mappings may not always be one-to-one and sometimes need interpretation.
One example is the CLIL<a
        href="#fn18"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref18"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> to Thema mapping, where the Young
Adults category can be mapped to two main Thema categories: Fiction
(Thema code F) and Children, Teenage and Educational (Thema code Y). As
a consequence, we had to spend time on understanding differences in
classification methodologies and which choices to apply to our
mappings.</p>
<p>The gap analysis shows that the heavy presence of images and visual
resources appears to be the main criterion of demarcation between
categories that will reclaim more efforts to remediate (Medicine, Earth
sciences and Sports) and others (Fiction, Philosophy, Religion and Law)
that are mainly text based and will be easier to remediate.</p>
<p>In the end, only the extraction of statistics from the files can
provide scorings capable of efficiently slicing large collections into
sets of ebooks with similar needs. Such an activity can help not only
with categorising accessibility needs but also with having a better view
of what contents are inside different ebooks (like the number of images,
number of pages, etc.).</p>

<p>Newer formats (like EPUB 3) are not adopted quickly. The newer
possibilities they offer (like reflow for EPUB over PDF, better
semantics for EPUB 3 over EPUB 2) do not cause older formats (like EPUB
2 or PDF) to be immediately replaced. This causes difficulties as the
remediation work is more complex when dealing with older formats. Like
the chicken and egg problem, the adoption of newer formats is slowed by
the lack of support by main desktop tools who are not willing to invest
in supporting less adopted formats. Consequently, conversion services
and proprietary tools have flourished, and too few open-source tools and
documentation are available.</p>
<h3
      id="markconversion-tools-as-options-for-remediationmark"><mark>Conversion
tools as options for remediation</mark></h3>
<p>Our research and discussions with the developers of the tools have
made it clear that many remediation tools were designed and developed to
respond to the internal needs of a specific publishing house or a
service provider working for one or more publishing houses, usually in
the continuity of the existing tools and contracts. Most of these
solutions are marketed as ebook <i>conversion</i> tools or used in the
context of <i>conversion services</i>. Therefore, most of these tools
are under continuous development and evolve to meet the needs of
different clients’ collections and specific requests.</p>
<p>To understand how these technological solutions can concretely fit
into the workflows of publishing houses, it is important to underline
that publishers can decide to use different tools to correct different
accessibility problems, based on what the different solutions are
capable of doing, for what formats and with what level of accuracy,
which makes the remediation process a composite and complex one.</p>
<p>Since digital accessibility is becoming an increasingly important
topic, the issue of remediating inaccessible ebooks and digital
documents is becoming increasingly important too. Consequently, the
landscape of remediation tools is bound to evolve and expand. For this
reason, we will continue to monitor the supply of these tools even after
the conclusion of the project and we’ll update the dedicated list<a
        href="#fn19"

        id="fnref19"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> on the official ABE Lab website
should we find new tools, since this represents valuable information for
publishing professionals.</p>
<h3
      id="markfew-markopen-sourcemark-tools-and-markdmarkocumentation-about-automatmarkionmark-markare-markavailablemark"><mark>Few
</mark>open-source<mark> tools and
</mark>d<mark>ocumentation about automat</mark>ion<mark>
</mark>are <mark>available</mark></h3>
<p>Our research and discussions with publishers, service providers and
tools producers showed that a lot of automation is used at every level,
but the rules applied for analysis and automation are established over
experience and kept in-house. A reason for that can be found in the fact
that it’s almost impossible to average the errors in the backlist titles
and that there’s a will (and a need) to keep a commercial advantage.
However, the consequence is that it is not possible to rely on
industry-accepted rules to make sure that automation is performed for
the best.</p>
<p>Regarding the availability of open-source tools that can be securely
incorporated into remediation workflows, we discovered a limited number
of available solutions beyond the widely recognised conformance checkers
named EPUBCheck and ACE by DAISY.</p>
<p>These tools have become the industry standard and are already
integrated into many publishers' production workflows. While
incorporating these tools into workflows is a positive step, it's
crucial to take note of the <span
        role="doc-pagebreak"
        id="page16"
        aria-label="Page 16"></span>ACE developers' disclaimer: <i>It
is important to keep in mind that only a limited portion of
accessibility checks can be automated, and therefore, Ace is not a
complete accessibility conformance evaluation tool; instead, it is an
aid for a broader, human-driven evaluation process.</i></p>
<p>The lack of recognised tools is somewhat worrying, as it suggests
that most accessibility issues are addressed using in-house developed
solutions. This results in redundant efforts when selecting and
evaluating the quality of remediation operations.</p>
<p>The availability of open-source solutions does not imply that
remediation tools necessarily have to use them, but knowing what the
open-source community has already produced can be a good starting point
when designing and developing, especially if these products are actively
maintained and updated.</p>
<p>All primary areas of software development extensively utilise
existing components provided by the open-source ecosystem. It is vital
to the software development landscape, offering scalability,
flexibility, and robustness. It helps everyone in the ecosystem save
time and money, enhance quality and security, foster innovation and
collaboration, and gain a competitive edge in the market.</p>
<h2
      id="is-there-a-market-for-remediation-tools">Is there a market for
remediation tools?</h2>
<p>Publishing is an umbrella name for activities related to the creation
and transmission of culture through books. Many different professional
profiles work in the industry. From rights acquisitions to innovative
marketing techniques, the shared knowledge about ebooks and digital
reading is not so wide and broad.</p>
<p>ebook sales represent around 12%<a
        href="#fn20"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref20"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> in the best cases, and
are still usually a digital replica of the printed object, being as much
as possible similar to the paper object.</p>
<p>Publishing houses, except the bigger ones who may have an internal
digital department, rely on the expertise of specialised external
services for the conversion in digital versions of the printed
ones..</p>
<p>Therefore, the following question arises: is there a market for
remediation tools dedicated to publishers? Or should we think that
service providers are the target of remediation tools vendors?</p>
<h3
      id="post-cmarkonversion-over-born-accessiblemark">Post
c<mark>onversion over born accessible</mark></h3>
<p>Accessibility experts have long emphasised the importance of
considering accessibility from the beginning of the publishing process,
as it can make a significant difference at a minimal additional cost. <a
        href="#fn21"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref21"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>. This is also a key principle of
digital-first workflows and single-source publishing.</p>
<p>However, the reality is that the publishing industry is still largely
focused on print. Books are typically designed for the printed edition
first, and then converted to create an ebook. This means that many
ebooks, especially those in the backlist, are missing important digital
information about their structure and formatting.</p>
<p>Instead, the structure of the book is often represented visually,
such as using italics for quotes or different fonts for headings. Only a
few publishing workflows are set up to manage rich semantic structures
and create ebooks that are natively accessible.</p>
<p><span
        role="doc-pagebreak"
        id="page17"
        aria-label="Page 17"></span>There are tools that can facilitate the conversion process,
but they are often linked to a specific service or offered as part of
hybrid licences, such as software as a service or different levels of
conversion service.</p>
<h3
      id="markexternal-expertisemark"><mark>External
expertise</mark></h3>
<p>As done for the creation of the digital versions, most publishers
view accessibility expertise as a service provided by third-party
contractors, rather than an inherent part of their own production
process. However, the definition of accessibility expertise is not
well-established, and publishers may encounter varying levels of quality
and accuracy in the services they receive. This can lead to different
experiences, including misleading or deceptive practices that fail to
meet the necessary accessibility standards. As a result, publishers must
exercise caution and carefully vet potential contractors to ensure they
possess the necessary expertise and can deliver high-quality accessible
ebooks.</p>
<p>France and Italy are exceptions where publisher associations provide
accessibility expertise. In France, this is done through guidelines and
discussions established by the <i>Normes et Standards</i> working
group. In Italy, this is done through the awareness of the topic raised
by Fondazione LIA, which is strongly related to the Italian Publishers
Association.</p>
<p>Many countries are still in the process of finding an effective
approach to accessible publishing. Collaborations between publishers and
specialised organization serving people with disabilities which may have
specific knowledge on some aspect of accessibility, may be fruitful. The
Apace project<a

<p>The gap analysis allowed us to establish a list of the most recurrent
accessibility issues found in the backlist ebooks, based on the
collected samples<a
        href="#fn23"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref23"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>. This list has been used for other
activities and can be considered a baseline for remediation needs that
will apply to most collections. The list is detailed in the <i>Gap
analysis</i> section of the <i>Report on backlist data and gap
analysis</i>. As a quick reminder, we are just providing here a
resume:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Missing Accessibility Metadata</p></li>
<li><p>Non-reflowable content</p></li>
<li><p>Missing or bad textual alternative for graphical
resources</p></li>
<li><p>Missing or bad Language Tags</p></li>
<li><p>Structure errors (Empty-Table-Header, Empty-Heading,
Heading-Order)</p></li>
<li><p>Missing semantics (Html-Has-Lang, Aria-Roles, Link-Name,
Document-Title, Epub-Type-Has-Matching-Role)</p></li>
<li><p>Possible navigation improvements (Landmark-Unique,
Epub-Toc-Order, Epub-Pagelist-Broken)</p></li>
<li><p>Contents and styling errors (Link-In-Text-Block,
Color-Contrast)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there are also accessibility issues that can’t be
detected automatically and that requires ad hoc human testing to be
identified. This concerns <i>reflowable restrictions</i> imposed by
style rules applied to the file, as well as s<i>pecific contents</i>
such as forms, scripts, maths, videos and audio, which are not usually
used in ebooks, but as this may happen, it will be necessary to include
them in the remediation process should they occur in a file.</p>
<h3
      id="test-suite">Test suite</h3>
<p>To test if the identified remediation tools offer functionalities to
fix the identified accessibility issues, we’ve built a set of test
files, one for each starting format (EPUB 2, EPUB 3, EPUB Fixed Layout,
PDF). We used these test files to carry out functional tests to assess
which functionalities were present in a tool and which were missing. In
these files, we included all the most recurrent accessibility issues
according to our analysis of the publisher's provided ebook
backlist.</p>
<p>The test suite is available from the ABE Lab website

publishers</mark></h2>
<p>As there are too few common denominators to classify backlist titles,
and because the EAA asks to assess and evaluate disproportionate burden
per title, the minimum to do to keep titles in sales is to acquire a
good knowledge of the collections.</p>
<p>This part can be done with support of existing automated evaluation
tools and distributors' sales reports. These steps will generate a
better understanding of the existing and therefore, reinforce the
publishing house at different levels, not only those related to
accessibility.</p>
<h3
      id="markhow-to-triage-filesmark"><mark>How to triage
files?</mark></h3>
<p>Collecting information and statistics is necessary to start a triage
and track decisions per book. At the moment of this report, no known
available tool exists to do so. This can be implemented in an integrated
information system or, by default, as a spreadsheet. For each title, it
is necessary to collect at least the following baseline information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>File format</p></li>
<li><p>Other formats the title is available in</p></li>
<li><p>Known production information like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Year of production</p></li>
<li><p>Source file (availability and format)</p></li>
<li><p>Service provider, if known</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Known editorial information like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The presence of languages different from the main
language</p></li>
<li><p>Images common to all books (cover, logos)</p></li>
<li><p>Number of images (except the common ones)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, it is an easy step to collect EPUBCheck and ACE
reports. This will allow publishers to add the following columns to the
spreadsheet:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Number of EPUBCheck errors (critical, serious and minor)</p></li>
<li><p>Number of ACE errors (critical, serious and minor)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More statistics and in-depth analysis can be generated following the
methodology used by the ABE Lab gap analysis or requiring services from
an accessibility consultancy organisation. We also expect that more
detailed analysis tools will be available shortly, as proposed by
distributors, service providers, or other actors. In the context of ABE
Lab, we have calculated three additional statistics sets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>statistics on the usage of HTML tags, attributes and values</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Number of times each tag and attribute appears in the
file</p></li>
<li><p>Attribute values and how many times a certain value appears for a
certain attribute (e.g. lang, class, role)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>a check whether the language attribute given by the content
creator is congruent with the text or not. We analysed the text of all
paragraphs with more than 5 words using a model trained with Machine
Learning techniques, which can guess language from plain text<a

      id="mark20how-to-evaluate-costmark"><mark>How to
evaluate cost?</mark></h3>
<p>The monetary costs of remediation of various ebooks vary strongly
from one country to another. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an
estimate in terms of prices and costs. Instead, we share the time frame
that, based on our experimentation, requires correcting each type of
accessibility error.</p>
<p>Remembering that one-off costs may apply to the organisation is also
important. These may include awareness, initial planning, workflow set
and tools selection, as well as training people and tools. Since most
publishers will first focus on modifying their workflows or
specifications for their contracted service providers to make their new
ebooks accessible, the associated organisational costs, such as
awareness and training, will likely be incurred before the remediation
process for backlist titles begins. Certain additional information will
be necessary to decide which backlist titles will be remediated, which
titles may be kept under disproportionate burden, and which may be
removed from the market. This may include legal information, cost
estimates for different remediation options and information about the
revenues to be expected. Insights on what it takes to remediate existing
titles will be the most difficult to get, and for this, some consultancy
might be required.</p>
<p>Defining the production cost associated with the backlist ebook
remediation activity requires taking into account which interventions
can be carried out automatically by the available remediation tools,
which adjustments require the intervention of a human operator expert on
accessibility, what the post-remediation quality control efforts are,
and if there are additional costs related to reintroducing the title in
the market. The next subsections give some insights to help with the
evaluation of production costs.</p>
<h4
      id="primary-considerations">Primary considerations</h4>
<p>There is currently no remediation technological solution or service
on the market that can process a large collection of files in one go,
but using the <i>Readium Go Toolkit</i>, it is possible to parse EPUB
files and add some basic accessibility metadata that can be inferred
from the ebook file to large collections (e.g. it can tell if the ebook
contains a table of contents, mathematical formulas in MathML or images,
but not if the associated alt text is meaningful, and it cannot check
whether the language attribute given by the content creator is congruent
with the actual language text).</p>
<p>There are tools for reflowable EPUBs that achieve a good level of
remediation at an affordable cost. But if the digital version of a
publication has been produced as a fixed-layout EPUB or PDF, based on
the results of our project, the most achievable option is not to
remediate the Fixed Layout or PDF file but to produce a newborn
accessible version of the title as a reflowable EPUB.</p>
<p>Graphical resources need dedicated treatment as they require an
editorial decision (is it necessary to add an alternative text?) and
action (writing an accurate alternative text). ACE report can provide a
list of images to help with this process.</p>
<h4
      id="time-for-basic-remediation-of-epub2-to-epub3">Time for basic
remediation of EPUB2 to EPUB3</h4>
<p>Based on our testing activities, we estimate that with the currently
available tools, 1 hour for an average EPUB 2 to be transformed to EPUB
3, and then remediated to meet the accessibility requirements of the
EAAis a reasonable time. Further enrichments (like adding page breaks
and page numbers) are not included in this evaluation.</p>
<p>The following list gives more details including minimum, maximum and
average times spent by the operator who performed the remediation
tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for the ‘simple’ fiction title (320 pages, 14 images), the total
time was 43 minutes minimum, 52 minutes on average, and 67 minutes
maximum</p></li>
<li><p><span
            role="doc-pagebreak"
            id="page21"
            aria-label="Page 21"></span>for a children’s book with mainly text, only a cover
image (288 pages, 19 images) the total time was 39 minutes minimum, 43
minutes on average and 48 minutes maximum</p></li>
<li><p>for a title with ‘medium complexity’ (category Society and Social
Sciences) (277 pages, 60 images, 20 tables, 150 links, 192 footnotes, 46
chapters) the total time was 55 minutes minimum, 64 minutes on average
and 73 minutes maximum. Note that time refers to time needed to
copy-paste a generic image descriptions, not the time required for
writing them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4
      id="time-for-conversion-and-remediation-of-pdf-to-reflowable-epub3">Time
for conversion and remediation of PDF to reflowable EPUB3</h4>
<p>Based on our testing activities, we estimate that converting a PDF
into an EPUB 3, and remediating the output file will take more time than
converting an EPUB 2 into an EPUB 3 and making it accessible (based on
the results of the ‘average’ files tested). Typically a day per file
would be plausible. Actual time per real book needs to be assessed case
by case.</p>
<p>The following list gives more details including minimum, maximum and
average times spent by the operator who performed the remediation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a sample with ‘medium complexity’ (Category Law) including 83
pages, 1 image, 55 links (hyperlinks and footnotes) took 54 minutes
minimum, 86 minutes on average and 118 minutes maximum. The full book is
492 pages including the cover, 1 image, 57 links, and around 770
footnotes, an EPUB would be around 24 chapters);</p></li>
<li><p>An extract of category Medical (22 pages, 13 images, 1 table and
4 links) took 63 minutes minimum, 72 minutes average and 81 minutes
maximum. The full book is 359 pages including the cover, 164 images, 21
tables, and 104 links (not counting TOC and index);</p></li>
<li><p>an illustrated children's book (57 pages, 37 images) took a
minimum of 22 minutes, an average of 25 and a maximum of 28;</p></li>
<li><p>another non-fiction extract, including 40 pages, 15 images, 31
links (hyperlinks and footnotes) took a minimum of 34, an average of 44
and a maximum of 55 minutes. The full book is 136 pages, 75 images, 146
links, and 28 footnotes).</p></li>

<p>Of the accessibility correction actions, the addition of
accessibility metadata is the one that can be accomplished most quickly.
This can be partially done by a batch use of the <i>Readium Go
Toolkit</i> (an open-source tool that can derive some basic and partial
accessibility metadata directly from files), by an in-house build script
reusing the inference rules proposed by the Readium Foundation, or by
publisher-specific inference rules created from the knowledge of the
collections. The result will be the addition of accessibility
information to ONIX records. We expect that some distributors will
propose prefilled formulas or Excel files depending on the usual
interexchange procedures in place. However, in most countries,
publishers remain legally accountable for the information provided, so
understanding the meaning of the most important accessibility
information is necessary. This learning can be achieved by reading the
resources proposed in the dedicated appendix.</p>

<p><i>Find</i>, <i>fix</i>, and <i>check</i> are the three key
aspects of accessibility remediation. Tools are expected to support
expert human operators by identifying the accessibility problem,
reporting it to them, and guiding them for applying corrections. For the
remediation to be effective, the tools should therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>find the accessibility issues contained in the ebook;</p></li>
<li><p>provide a way to correct the identified accessibility issues, for
example, via dedicated options;</p></li>
<li><p>check the conformance of the file to ensure the output will be
valid with the file format specification and compliant with the target
accessibility guidelines or standards. Accessibility checks carried out
before export, or at the operator's request, are also strategically
important to ensure that the ebook does not have accessibility problems
before it is exported and checked with external tools.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Publishers' needs vary greatly, depending on the size of the
collections, in-house knowledge, and many other factors. Therefore, the
remediation tools that will be used can take many different forms and
levels of complexity. It is important to identify which operator
audience the individual tool is aimed at by providing clear, detailed
documentation on how the remediation tool works and what it offers to
make the work easier and faster. Minimum viable information that must be
found is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Input and output formats</p></li>
<li><p>Accepted contents complexity</p></li>
<li><p>Accessibility Target (EPUB Accessibility, WCAG, EAA, ADA,
PDF/UA)</p></li>
<li><p>Type of licence and plan</p></li>
<li><p>Safety of the data</p></li>
<li><p>Machine Learning policy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although the objective of the ABE Lab project is not to guide the
design, usability, and accessibility of graphical interfaces of
remediation tools, it would be great if these were compliant with the
requirements defined by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
2, the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG), and the technical
standard EN 301 549. An accessible interface would represent added value
and make the remediation tool usable by many operators. The following
key points should be regarded with caution:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In-tool support. There should be attention to providing as much
support as possible to guide the human operators in fixing the
accessibility errors, to reduce the number of iterations needed to the
minimum;</p></li>
<li><p>Improve, don't disrupt. The remediation tool must not cause a
loss of information, must not add accessibility errors and must not
compromise the technical integrity of the file. When converting a PDF
into an accessible PDF, the original layout and design should be
maintained: fonts, colours, and graphic elements should not be affected
during the remediation phase, and the accessible file respects the
graphics of the source file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span

        aria-label="Page 23"></span>An ebook can contain many different types of accessibility
errors. Analysing a sample of backlist files, we found that some
accessibility problems recur with particular frequency; these are
detailed in the Gap analysis<a

tool functionalities</mark></h3>
<p>Evaluating a tool is a complex activity and involves multifaceted
aspects. One of these is represented by the expectations of those who
evaluate the instrument, which largely depends on their specific needs.
A tool could be evaluated based on the results it allows to obtain even
when used by non-expert users. At the same time, what is sought may be a
tool capable of integrating effectively and fluidly into existing
workflows and which therefore potentially requires advanced coding and
programming skills. The ideal solution may also be platforms or programs
that allow making batch modifications to large quantities of files.
Combining such broad and varied expectations would make a complex
checklist. Hence, the checklist we prepared focuses on the features
related to the most recurring accessibility issues highlighted by the
gap analysis.</p>
<p>The checklists reported in part 4 of the <i>Guidelines</i><a
        href="#fn28"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref28"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> can be used as methodological
support that allows one to obtain a clearer view of the current state of
a tool. They are provided to help stakeholders, remediation tools
producers and developers check the state of the art of their tools and
to plan future developments.</p>
<p>However, they do not claim to be a complete and definitive list to
assess the quality or completeness of a remediation tool, nor does
meeting all the points in the list guarantee that the remediated files
will be fully accessible and compliant with the requirements of the EAA
and international accessibility guidelines.</p>
<p>It’s also important to highlight that these guidelines might not be
maintained after the end of the project. Therefore, they can not be used
to claim conformity with the latest level of required accessibility and
must not be used as a marketing or commercial argument.</p>
<p>The points of the checklists and the content of the guidelines are
high-level indications that can be relevant for remediation tools
regardless of the input file format.</p>

      id="leveraging-impacts">Leveraging impacts</h1>
<p>The expected impacts of the ABE Lab project detailed in the
Activities section are considered over three periods: short term (before
2025), medium Term (2025 – 2026) and long Term (2026 – 2030). They
follows three axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>analysis of the composition of the ebook backlist</p></li>
<li><p>classification of the remediation needs of the ebooks of the
backlist</p></li>
<li><p>assessments of the associated costs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that the outcomes of this project will be useful in achieving
significant impacts in the publishing industry. However, we recognize
that there are still challenges related to consolidating these impacts
over the long term. As a result, we propose additional activities that
we believe would be valuable for all stakeholders in the publishing
chain. These activities should address the needs of a diverse ecosystem,
including smaller actors, by providing tools and resources. However,
it's important to consider the sustainability of every actor involved,
beyond just technical solutions. This includes the work of experts on
standardisation and advocacy, as well as efforts to raise awareness and
build confidence among readers who would benefit from accessible ebooks.
Ultimately, these activities should aim to create a sustainable and
inclusive publishing ecosystem that benefits everyone involved.</p>
<p>The consolidations to consider are following four axes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>efficient decision-making at organisation and national levels,
enabled by a clear picture of the state of the ebook backlist;</p></li>
<li><p>publishers level evaluation of the composition of their
collections and associated remediation costs based on expert-established
analysis methodology;</p></li>
<li><p>a greater number of ebooks made accessible with a high level of
quality made possible by enhanced technical workflows and
tools;</p></li>
<li><p>an easier process for future production and a better repartition
of knowledge over the value chain thanks to the sum of information
provided in the project communications<a
            href="#fn29"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref29"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The next sections detail our propositions to provide ecosystem-level
mechanisms and help with shaping the future of accessible ebooks.</p>
<h2
      id="consistent-data-collection-and-analysis-methodology">Consistent
data collection and analysis methodology</h2>
<p>ABE Lab represents a very new picture, providing as good work as
possible per today's state of data collection (more than expected at the
beginning). Publishers, unions for the blind and visually impaired, and
public services have, for the first time, a picture of the status of the
European ebook backlist, but it’s a quick snapshot; available data will
not allow for yearly comparisons in the foreseeable future and the view
presented here might soon become obsolete.</p>
<p>Another aspect is that the picture is clear, but the content is
noisy, and clarifications could only be done by yearly aggregations and
refining. There is a need for a longer time view to highlight and
valorate the industry efforts and progress made.</p>
<p><span
        role="doc-pagebreak"
        id="page25"
        aria-label="Page 25"></span></p><h2
      id="classification-wizard-service">Classification wizard
service</h2>
<p>ABE Lab has developed a methodology for classifying ebooks in a way
that supports efficient remediation. This methodology can be used by
more technically oriented publishers to evaluate the composition of
their own ebook backlist.</p>
<p>To address this gap, there is a need for tools that can help
publishers calculate the cost of remediation for each segment of their
backlist and support them in defining their priorities. These tools
should be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to publishers of
all sizes.</p>
<p>However, creating and maintaining such tools requires specific
investments and a sustainable economic model. It's important to ensure
that these tools are not only effective in the short term but also
viable over the long term. This may involve exploring different funding
models, such as subscription-based services or partnerships with
industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the goal is to provide publishers with the resources they
need to make informed decisions about ebook remediation and prioritize
accessibility in a way that is sustainable and cost-effective. By doing
so, we can work towards creating a more inclusive publishing ecosystem
that benefits everyone involved.</p>
<h2
      id="enhanced-workflow-documentation">Enhanced workflow
documentation</h2>
<p>One of the stronger reasons for the permanence of old formats is
their long-time integration in production and reading environments.
Facilitating the production, conversion, enhancement and manipulation of
file formats is a key factor in helping with their adoption.</p>
<p>The role of the Readium Foundation in facilitating the building of
reading systems has been decisive in the diffusion of the standardised
EPUB format and created the environment for the rise of economic model
opportunities, liberating the industry from the silos built by big tech
companies. Because open-source SDKs rely on standards, it also opened
the way to more widely adopted accessibility features in reading
systems.</p>
<p>There is an equivalent need for EPUB production: more authoring tools
are needed, and to open the way and shape a viable economic environment,
documentation and open source SDKs are a way to pave the road. Helping
those developments is as necessary as the consultancy provided to
mainstream products.</p>
<h2
      id="research-on-ai">Research on AI</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and other forms of
automation can speed up remediation work. However, these technologies
are far from perfect and sometimes lead to unexpected, if not incorrect,
results. Since this technology is rapidly evolving, studying and
monitoring future developments will be crucial. A publisher-oriented
solution is also becoming necessary to work on editorial products
efficiently.</p>
<p>Publishers and other actors in the publishing chain have been using
automation, including Natural Language Processing and Artificial
Intelligence technologies, for several years already. Now facing the
revolutions of Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative AI
technologies (GAI), they are observing, testing and defining positions
towards this technology and its use in editorial workflows. This has
led, in some cases, to express concerns related to the uncertainty about
how their contents and files are used by such systems.</p>
<p><span
        role="doc-pagebreak"
        id="page26"
        aria-label="Page 26"></span>In the current state of the art, Machine Learning systems
cannot replace the competence and evaluation ability of a human being.
If it is possible, for example, to automatically generate alternative
descriptions for images with AI, it has yet to be proved that these
alternative descriptions can provide information equivalent to that
conveyed by the images themself or that they are comparable to those
produced by a subject expert. Human decision-making is still key to
determining whether such descriptions are appropriate for a given
context, and there are probably ways to facilitate this validation
operation.</p>
<p>More accurate results can probably be achieved by additional actions
to help conduct machines to the most probable correct and pertinent
textual alternative and also to help with automated evaluation of this
pertinence or detect probable wrong or insufficient proposals. These
actions can be built only on data mining over large curated collections
and through multiple iterations. To make sure that such experiments are
conducted taking into account publishers' concerns and the results are
assessed in relation to the real needs of readers, we think it is
important that professional membership organisations and accessibility
experts are involved in monitoring research activities.</p>

<p>The two following subsections establish industry events and key
points to collect to establish a good knowledge of the collections. All
of them will probably not apply to each collection; they are to be
assessed and selected based on the country, the publishing house, and
the ebook collection.</p>
<h2
      id="industry-facts-to-know">Industry facts to know</h2>
<p>There are some dates that have affected the ebook production workflow
widely. They are good to know and may help identify, understand and
classify ebooks. However, they did not affect all files, and certainly
not simultaneously.</p>
<p>EPUBCheck is a validation tool for EPUB files, and it has undergone
several versions since its inception. Here are the main EPUBCheck
versions<a
        href="#fn30"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref30"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> and their corresponding EPUB
specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>EPUBCheck1.x: this version was released around the time of the
EPUB 2.0.1 specification, published in 2010. EPUB 2.0.1 was an update to
the original EPUB 2.0 specification, released in 2007;</p></li>
<li><p>EPUBCheck3.x: this version corresponds to the EPUB 3.0
specification, which was published in 2014. EPUBCheck 3.0.1 was released
in 2015, and EPUBCheck 3.2.1 was released in 2021. These versions of
EPUBCheck are used to validate EPUB 3.0 and later files;</p></li>
<li><p>EPUBCheck 4.x: this version corresponds to the EPUB 3.2
specification, which was published in 2017. EPUBCheck 4.0.0 was released
in 2018, and EPUBCheck 4.2.1 was released in 2021. These versions of
EPUBCheck are used to validate EPUB 3.2 and later files;</p></li>
<li><p>EPUBCheck4.1.0 (November 2018) was the first release under the
DAISY Consortium maintenance role. It notably introduces better support
for the EPUB Accessibility Vocabulary, reports duplicate landmarks and
not unique landmarks anchors and reports for CSS absolute positioning as
well as font size validation;</p></li>
<li><p>EPUBCheck5.0.0 (January 2023) is the version testing EPUB 3.3
rules. It notably includes checking <i>epub:type</i> restrictions,
considering HTML form elements as scripted content, reporting empty
title elements in XHTML Content Documents, allow remote resources in
scripted content and fonts, disallowing remote links in TOC, landmarks
and pagelist navigation, allowing <i>epub:type</i> on all HTML
elements as well as extend authorised ARIA roles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is also important to notice that EPUBCheck includes checks from
the W3C markup validator<a
        href="#fn31"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref31"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>.</p>
<p>ACE 1.0 was released in January 2018. Two intermediary versions are
to consider: 1.1 (April 2019), 1.2 (April 2021). Since then, one
maintenance update has been released almost every year. ACE's full
changelog can be consulted on the ACE GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Adobe InDesign<a
        href="#fn32"
        class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref32"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> has supported EPUB 3 export since
the release of InDesign CC 2015 in June 2015. InDesign CC 2017

introduced PDF Accessibility enhancements and added support for MathML.
Fondazione LIA is leading a group of experts working to provide insights
to Adobe and guide the InDesign development team on missing or incorrect
InDesign export features for accessible EPUB. The group is the result of

<p><span
        role="doc-pagebreak"
        id="page28"
        aria-label="Page 28"></span>Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) platform has
accepted EPUB files for conversion into the Kindle format (.mobi or
.kpf) since 2016. Amazon does have its own validation process to ensure
that the EPUB files uploaded to KDP meet certain quality standards. This
validation uses a custom validation tool based on the EPUB specification
to check for potential issues and inconsistencies in the uploaded
files.</p>
<p>Kobo has been using EPUBCheck as a requirement for ebooks published
through their platform, Kobo Writing Life, for several years. Although
there is no specific date mentioned in their public resources, it is
generally assumed that this requirement has been in place since the
early days of Kobo Writing Life, which was launched in 2012.</p>
<p>Apple Books has been accepting EPUB files since the launch of the
iBooks app in 2010, and it remains the standard file format for
publishing ebooks on the platform. Apple Books does not explicitly
impose EPUBCheck as a requirement for EPUB files. However, Apple
strongly recommends using EPUBCheck to validate your EPUB files before
submitting them for publication on Apple Books.</p>
<p>While EPUB is an open standard for ebooks, some ebook vendors and
publishers use proprietary technologies within EPUB files to add
enhanced features or to protect their content. It's important to note
that while these proprietary technologies can add enhanced features or
protect content, they can also limit interoperability and compatibility
between different ebook vendors and devices. As a result, it's generally
recommended to use open standards and avoid proprietary technologies
whenever possible.</p>

      id="key-points-to-assess-the-knowledge-of-collections">Key
points to assess the knowledge of collections</h2>
<p>Ebooks have been produced over more than twenty years. In this
timelapse, many things may have happened, from responsible people
shifting to stakeholders' decisions and passing by distributors' and
vendors' policies.</p>
<p>To be able to identify groups of ebooks in the backlist with
potentially similar remediation requirements, first of all, it is
important to reconstruct the production history of the backlist files.
The following elements may help separate ebooks in stacks per year of
production. They are presented as an ordered list for easy reference,
and the order reflects their importance.</p>
<ol
      type="1">
<li><p><i>Was there a file quality control established, what did it
address and with which tools?</i> File quality control is usually a
checklist that helps eliminate some common errors. If
industry-recognized tools like EPUBCheck or ACE were used, it would help
identify some patterns (see section <i>Industry facts to
know</i>).</p></li>
<li><p><i>Was there, and since when, one or more specifications, and
did it have a dedicated accessibility requirement?</i> The presence of
contractual documents certainly gives strong indicators that can be used
to separate collections.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Is there internal documentation of the choices made in
production?</i> In complement or by default of the precedent structured
documents, editorial and production choices may have affected the
quality of the produced ebooks. This may include graphical resources
policies, decisions to convert tables as images, addition of page
markers, etc. Such documentation can be rebuilt by collecting and dating
events.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Is there, and since when a person responsible for the digital
production activities?</i> When responsible for digital production,
people usually have a long-time view that implies minimum consistency in
the choices made.</p></li>
<li><p>If the production has been outsourced, <i>has the relationship
with service providers been maintained? Are they still
suppliers?</i></p></li>
<li><p>If the production has been made in-house, <i>how many people
have been involved, and how long did they stay on?</i></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Secondly, it is necessary to assess the knowledge of the
collections.</p>
<ol
      type="1">
<li><p>How many titles are there in the backlist?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the digital versions available in different formats? Is there
a need to maintain all formats?</p></li>
<li><p>What software was used for production?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the source files still available in a usable format?</p></li>
<li><p>What resources are included in the ebook?</p></li>
